# Image Compression using Huffman Coding

## Project Overview:
This project implements image compression using the Huffman coding technique, aiming to reduce redundant bits in image data while preserving information content and minimizing memory usage. The implementation explores the application of Weberâ€™s Law in quantizing image intensity to optimize compression efficiency. The Python code categorizes pixel intensities into distinct classes based on human perceptual sensitivity, facilitating efficient representation and improved compression ratios.

## Project Structure:
- **`compression.py`:** Python script containing the implementation of Huffman coding for image compression.
- **`image.jpg`:** Sample input image for compression.
- **`compressed_image.bin`:** Output file containing the compressed image data.
- **`decompression.py`:** Python script containing the implementation of Huffman coding for image decompression.
- **`decompressed_image.jpg`:** Output file containing the decompressed image data.

## Usage:
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the compression script:

Replace `image.jpg` with the path to your input image file and `compressed_image.bin` with the desired name for the compressed output file.
5. After compression, run the decompression script:

Replace `compressed_image.bin` with the path to your compressed image file and `decompressed_image.jpg` with the desired name for the decompressed output image file.
6. The decompressed image will be saved as `decompressed_image.jpg` in the project directory.
